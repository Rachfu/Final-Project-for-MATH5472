The intruction.m file illustrates the code to use in the window of commander. The other m files are functions used in the experiment.

As for the experiment of Small Dense Lasso, the following functions should be used:
objective.m; shrinkage.m; factor.m; lasso.m; lasso_1.m; lasso_2.m; lasso_3.m

As for the experiment of Group Lasso with Feature Splitting, the following functions should be used:
objective_1.m; x_update.m; group_lasso_feat_split.m; group_lasso_feat_split_1.m
Besides, the package CVX should be downloaded at: http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/ to use function vec

As for the experiment of Regressor Selection, the following functions should be used:
objective_2.m; keep_largest.m; regressor_sel.m
